Bean:

@Bean indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by Spring Container.

By default, bean name is same as method name.
We can specify the bean name using @Bean(name="beanName")

@Bean annotation provides "init()" and "destroy()" to perform certain actions after bean initialization or before bean destruction by a container.
